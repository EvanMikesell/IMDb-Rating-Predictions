Some of these files were too large to upload to github. 
The will still display the code and results of the algorithms.

Dependencies are matplotlib version 3.2.2, pandas 1.0.5, and sklearn, all of which can be installed with anaconda. 
I used the anaconda navigator, went into the environments, and installed each of these. 

You can also do:
    pip install -U matplotlib
    pip install pandas
    pip install -U scikit-learn
   
Or use these links:
    https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/installing/index.html
    https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/install.html
    https://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html

To run the code, you can simply run each cell in order in the notebook.
